what is exactly lambda?

it is use to do backend stuff without using server like we do in ec2

it runs only when triggred

Lambda does not care about HTTP.
API Gateway translates HTTP → JSON event.

It works like:

Trigger happens
→ AWS starts your function
→ Your code runs
→ Returns something
→ AWS shuts it down

What's an event?
consider it as a input

whats context?
it contains things like:
Function name
Memory
Timeout
Request ID
