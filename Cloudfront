What is cloudfront?

lets just say for it acts as middle ground while hosting site using S3.
because the one thing i notice while hosting site using S3 - the URL is litrally exposing all the details like the server location 

also S3 is hosted in particular region and to make it global we use cloudfront..

user -> cloudfront -> S3

We use CloudFront in front of S3 to enable HTTPS, global caching, and improved performance while reducing direct S3 exposure
